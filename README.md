## Bamazon:


Bamazon is an virtual online storefront using JavaScript, Node.js and MySQL.

The node app bamazonCustomer.js will take purchases from customers and remove inventory from the store's stock. The user will be prompted to select the product they would like to buy and the quantity of the purchase. 

If the item the customer chooses is available, the item will be successfully sold and the total amount of the purchase will be displayed, otherwise "insuffecient stock" will be displayed to the customer.
